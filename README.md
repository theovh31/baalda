## What is Baalda?

Baalda is a local-first desktop app for notes and knowledge: your second brain. Every note is a plain `.md` file on your own disk, so your data is always yours. What makes Baalda different is that those same files are:

- **Editable by AI.** Because notes are plain files, a local agent like Claude Code edits them right on your disk with zero setup. Cloud and autonomous agents connect through the built-in MCP endpoint. Either way, the AI works your notes like a teammate would.
- **Shared in real time.** Invite people, share a folder, and edit the same note together with live cursors.

You get the openness of local Markdown files *and* the collaboration of a shared doc, in one app.

---

## Why it exists

AI is only as good as the context you give it. A team that wants one shared, always-current context layer quickly discovers that every existing tool forces a choice:

| You can have… | …but not… |
|---|---|
| Notes as plain files an AI can edit | Real-time team collaboration |
| Real-time team collaboration | Notes as plain files an AI can edit |

Why? The two are built on incompatible foundations. AI-editable notes need loose Markdown on disk as the source of truth. Real-time collaboration is built on CRDTs, whose state is an opaque binary blob. No tool combined them.

We scanned **41** open-source Obsidian-like apps against **12 core requirements** and none satisfied all 12. Baalda is the missing bridge between the two worlds, and that bridge is the whole product.

---

## Highlights

- 📄 **Your notes are just files.** Plain `.md` on disk. No lock-in, works with Git, and survives even if the server disappears.
- 🤖 **AI-editable, two ways.** Local-first means a local agent (Claude Code, Codex, any CLI tool) edits the `.md` files directly, no integration needed. Autonomous and cloud agents use the built-in [MCP](#-connect-an-ai-mcp) endpoint, gated by the exact same permissions as a human. Both paths merge live with everyone else's edits.
- 👥 **Real-time collaboration.** Invite teammates and edit together with live cursors. Notes are **private by default** — share a folder or single file with the whole team or one person (view or edit), and folders/renames/moves sync live too.
- 🔒 **Local-first and private.** A full desktop app that works offline. Your Markdown never travels the network in plain text; only opaque binary sync updates do, and each device re-derives its own `.md` files.
- 🔎 **Fast search and links.** Built-in full-text search (SQLite FTS5), backlinks, and tags, all indexed locally.
- 🖥️ **Native and cross-platform.** A lightweight Tauri v2 app for macOS, Windows, and Linux (iOS planned).
- 🛠️ **Self-hostable.** Runs entirely on your own infrastructure (Tauri + Node + Postgres). No vendor lock-in.
- 📎 **Attachments included.** Images and files sync alongside your notes.

## Built to scale

Baalda is built to grow with you, from a personal vault to a whole company:

| | |
|---|---|
| 📚 **Millions of notes** | a vault keeps growing without slowing down |
| 👥 **Thousands of teammates online** | connected and kept in sync at the same time |
| ✍️ **Hundreds editing together** | people writing in the same space, live |
| ⚡ **Instant open** | notes are already up to date before you click, no waiting |

Need more? It scales out to handle **tens of thousands** of people at once.

---

## How it works

The core idea in one sentence: **the `.md` file on disk is the durable source of truth, and a live CRDT keeps every open copy in sync.**

- When you (or an AI) change a file, a watcher turns the change into CRDT **operations**.
- When a teammate edits the shared note, those operations flow back and are written to your file.

Every change funnels through the same CRDT as operations, never whole-file overwrites. Whether it comes from a person typing, an AI rewriting a paragraph, or a teammate across the world, edits **merge** instead of overwriting each other.

</div>

Everything else (the desktop app, the search index, the sync server) is a rebuildable layer on top of your files.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Why this one |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Desktop shell | **Tauri v2** (Rust core) | Real filesystem access behind a web UI, in a fraction of Electron's footprint |
| UI | **React + Vite + TypeScript** | Typed IPC boundary to Rust; the UI never touches the disk itself |
| Editor | **CodeMirror 6** | The buffer *is* the Markdown — no rich-text model to translate through |
| Files & watcher | **Rust** (`std::fs` / `tokio::fs`) | Atomic writes plus a debounced watcher, so edits from an AI or `git` are noticed |
| Local index | **SQLite** (FTS5 search + backlinks + tags) | Entirely derived — deletable, and rebuilt from the `.md` files on demand |
| Real-time sync | **Yjs** CRDT + **Hocuspocus** server | A human typing and an AI rewriting a paragraph merge as operations, not overwrites |
| Database | **Postgres** (binary sync store) | Holds opaque Yjs updates only; your Markdown never travels the wire |
| Accounts & teams | **Better Auth** (argon2id, organizations) | Vaults map onto organizations, with per-folder permissions layered on top |
| AI access | **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) endpoint | Cloud agents get a vault through the same ACL that governs people |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 22 (with corepack: `corepack enable` activates the pinned pnpm)
- **Rust** & Cargo ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **Docker** (for the Postgres database)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
cd apps/server
cp .env.example .env      # adjust JWT_SECRET for anything real
pnpm run db:up            # start Postgres in Docker (host port 5439)
pnpm run migrate          # create the database schema
pnpm run dev              # HTTP API :3010 · sync WS at :3010/sync (a legacy dedicated :3011 also listens)
```

### 3. Start the desktop app

From the `app/` directory:

```bash
pnpm run dev:desktop      # launches the Tauri app (Vite on :1420)
```

Open a folder of Markdown files (or create a new one) and start writing.

### Prefer not to run a server?

Everything above is self-hosted and free. If you'd rather skip the backend ops,
[baalda.com](https://baalda.com) offers a managed backend for multi-device sync,
real-time team collaboration, and hosted AI. The desktop app is identical either
way: in Settings, set the server URL to `https://api.baalda.com` (managed) or to
your own instance.

### I want my own hosted server

To run a server for your team without managing machines, deploy one to Railway in
a click — it provisions Postgres, generates its own signing secret, runs the
migrations and gives you an HTTPS URL:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/baalda-server?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=baalda)

Then paste that URL into the desktop app's **Server settings** and create an
account. See [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) for details.

Prefer your own machine? The Compose bundle brings up the same stack in one
command:

```bash
cd deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env      # fill in POSTGRES_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_URL
docker compose up -d
```

See [`deploy/compose/README.md`](deploy/compose/README.md) for TLS, backups and
upgrades, or [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) for plain Docker and the full
environment variable reference.

## 🤖 Connect an AI (MCP)

A **local** agent needs no setup at all: point Claude Code (or any tool) at your vault folder and it edits the `.md` files directly. The watcher picks up every change and syncs it live to your team.

For **cloud and autonomous agents** that can't reach your disk, Baalda exposes a **Model Context Protocol** endpoint, so any MCP-speaking AI client can work with your vault exactly like a person, limited by the same per-folder permissions.

1. In the app, go to **Vault settings → MCP** and create a token.
2. Register the endpoint with your AI client, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http context http://localhost:3010/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer mcp_…"
```

(On the managed service the endpoint is `https://api.baalda.com/api/mcp`; for a
self-hosted server, use your server URL plus `/api/mcp`.)

The AI can now `read_note`, `search_notes`, `create_note`, `edit_note` (targeted replace/insert/delete at exact anchors), `update_note`, and more. `read_note` returns a `revision`; pass it back as `expectedRevision` and a write against a note that changed in between is refused instead of merged. Its writes flow through the same sync engine, so if the note is open you'll watch the AI type in real time.
