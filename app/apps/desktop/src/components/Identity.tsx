   seed renders the same character on every machine. Backgrounds are drawn

 * has bumped `lastSyncedAt`, so it reads "Synced · just now" and counts up.
 *
 * `progress` is the VAULT's bulk run, and it outranks `status` (the open note's
 * CONNECTION) whenever it is live. Those two are genuinely independent: the
 * socket can be perfectly "synced" while 380 of 500 notes have never reached the
 * server, and reporting "Synced · just now" there is precisely the lie this
 * progress exists to kill.
 *
 * `noteOpen: false` puts the pill in vault-wide mode: `status` belongs to a
 * socket that doesn't exist, so the label is derived from `progress` alone —
 * counter while running, "Synced" once done, the failure count on error.
