// The sidebar's BASE arrangement — what the tree looks like before the user's
// own drag-and-drop arrangement is layered on top of it.
//
// Two layers, and the order between them is the whole design:
//
//   sortTree()  →  the base order, from a preference (recent / A–Z)
//   applyOrder() →  the user's manual per-folder arrangement, pinned on top
//
// Because `applyOrder` ranks the items a folder has been arranged with and
// leaves every *unranked* item in the order it received, sorting first means
// changing the sort can never disturb an arrangement someone made by hand: a
// folder they dragged into place keeps its position, while the folders and
// files they never touched — including everything inside that folder — follow
// the sort. That is the property to preserve if this is ever refactored.
//
// Pure and dependency-free (the TreeNode import is type-only) so it tests in a
// plain Node environment.

 * files: a bulk wave in a 1,560-note vault moved 1,372 mtimes inside three
 * minutes (measured 2026-09-04). Every one of those writes re-sorted the folder
 * it was in, and arborist positions rows absolutely — so the row under the
 * pointer became a *different* row several times a second. That is the sidebar
 * "blinking on hover" and the clicks that "land on the wrong thing / feel
 * blocked" while something syncs: the highlight follows the cursor, but the
 * content beneath it keeps being replaced.
 *
 * So while the sidebar is being used (or while a wave is in flight), sort by the
 * mtime each row was FIRST seen with. `pins` is the caller's memory of that,
 * keyed by path: a path already in it keeps its remembered key, a new path
 * records its current one (so a note created mid-wave still appears at the top,
 * where it belongs). Clearing `pins` thaws it, and the next sort is the true one.
 *
 * Folders are untouched — they sort by name in both modes.
