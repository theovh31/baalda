/**
 * Inbound structural reconciliation: what to change ON DISK because the server's
 * folder/note structure moved.
 *
 * The registry has always pushed local structure UP. It had no downstream half at
 * all, and the three consequences were all visible to users:
 *   - a note a teammate deleted stayed on disk forever and got re-registered,
 *     leaving a permanent sidebar entry that could never sync;
 *   - a note a teammate renamed became TWO files — the old path keeping the
 *     content, the new path materialized empty;
 *   - a folder created remotely with nothing in it never appeared at all, because
 *     the only thing that ever created a local folder was the user's own
 *     right-click. That made every MCP-created folder invisible on every device.
 *
 * This module is the decision layer, deliberately pure: no IPC, no API, no
 * filesystem. It takes four maps and returns a plan. That means every rule below
 * is testable as a table, which matters more here than anywhere else in the
 * codebase — this is the code that decides to delete someone's notes.
