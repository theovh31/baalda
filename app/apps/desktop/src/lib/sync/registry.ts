// Vault ↔ server registry reconciliation (spec 03 §5 "doc registry mapping").
//
// On vault-connect (signed in, with an active org) we make the server aware of
// this vault's folders and notes so that `doc_id`s are STABLE and SHARED across
// devices. We adopt existing server rows by path, and for anything missing we
// create it USING THE LOCAL INDEX doc_id (the server honours a supplied id) so a
// note keeps one identity across its .md file, the local CRDT store, and the
// server. The resulting {relPath → {vaultId, docId}} map is what the sync layer
// uses to name Hocuspocus documents.
//
// The mapping is persisted to the vault's own `.context/config.json` (via ipc),
// so it travels with the vault, not the app profile.
//
// Bulk behaviour (phase 2). Registering a large vault is a bounded, checkpointed,
// cancellable, honest operation:
//   • bounded — folders (level by level, parents first) and notes go through a
//     `runPool` at `REGISTRY_CONCURRENCY`, not a sequential await-in-a-loop;
//   • checkpointed — the doc-id map is flushed incrementally (`Checkpointer`), so
//     a kill -9 at note 200/500 keeps the first 200 and the next run resumes;
//   • cancellable — every lane re-checks the VaultScope before each item;
//   • honest — a per-item failure is retried with backoff and then RECORDED
//     (`failures()`), so a vault with failures can never report fully synced.
