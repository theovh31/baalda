// VaultScope — the generation token every vault-scoped async operation runs
// under. This is the fix for a whole class of data-corrupting vault-switch bugs.
//
// The problem it solves: `syncManager`, its `VaultRegistry`, `VaultDocStore`,
// `AttachmentSync` and their debounced timers are process singletons, while
// Rust holds ONE global vault slot. So any async work started for vault A that
// is still in flight when the user switches to vault B lands on B's folder with
// A's server ids — creating A's folders/notes on B's server rows, merging A's
// doc-id map into B's `.context/config.json`, materializing A's note paths as
// empty files inside B. Switching back merges the other direction.
//
// The rule: capture the scope you began under, and bail the moment
// `isCurrent()` is false — silently, no throw, because "the user moved on" is
// not an error. Belt and braces on top of correct teardown ordering, because a
// future call site WILL get the ordering wrong.
//
// This mirrors `BridgeManager.generation` (src/lib/bridge/adapter.ts), which
// already guards note switches the same way — same pattern, vault-wide.
//
// Deliberately a pure leaf module: no imports at all, so it is trivially
// testable and can be read by any layer (including `bridge/adapter.ts`) without
// creating a cycle.
