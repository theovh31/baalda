 *
 * This used to special-case an explicit `:3010` and bump it to the dedicated
 * Hocuspocus port `:3011`, "for local dev". That assumption broke every
 * single-port self-host: the Docker Compose bundle publishes ONLY 3010, so with
 * a server URL of `http://localhost:3010` the vault channel connected (one TCP
 * connection to :3010, structure and downloads fine) while every per-note
 * provider — the path ALL content uploads take — dialled a port nothing was
 * listening on, timed out, and the run gave up after ten failures. The server
 * held a `notes` row and no content for every file, forever (#79). The server
 * has served `/sync` on the HTTP port since single-port deploys existed, so the
 * dedicated port is never needed by a client; `HOCUSPOCUS_PORT` stays for
 * anything else that still dials it.
