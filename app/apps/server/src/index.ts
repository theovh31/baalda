 * Entry point. Runs two listeners in one Node process:
 *   - HTTP API (Hono + Better Auth) on PORT (default 3010). The Hocuspocus
 *     sync WebSocket is ALSO reachable here at /sync, via the same shared
 *     instance below — this is what single-port deploys (Docker/Railway) use.
 *   - Hocuspocus WebSocket sync on HOCUSPOCUS_PORT (default 3011), kept
 *     as-is for back-compat with existing desktop builds and local dev.
 * See README "Ports".
